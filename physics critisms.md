the physics are way too stiff, to lightweight and too grippy.
and I need to fix all of that.

the physics remaster, where I use 6dof joints for the engine, transmission and wheels.
which all have rigidbodies btw.

will all behave how bodies in motion should, plus, I will integrate them as much as possible into the physics code.
