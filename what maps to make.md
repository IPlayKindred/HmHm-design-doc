to make the next maps, use the [[map making plan]]

early game map:

- boston + some misc areas:
	   ![[shutterstock_471847652.0.jpg]]
	- the main roads are easy to drive on and copy the flow of most wanted 2012.
	- jumps from main roads lead to secondary roads.
	- secondary roads are the liminal space between main and 3rd roads.
	- 3rd roads can be as wild, open, tight as you want, go wild.
	- 3rd roads can be tracks, extremely intensive jumps. or rally roads disguised. 
	- all the roads can lead to each other except for the main road.

we have come full circle, I think I'll just copy the mw12 map. and I mean in copy, just take inspiration. and add my own twist.

infact, take the layout, add the removed areas like golden meadows and make it flow better.
