what's the purpose of this game? why should people pick it over something else?

people chose games because it has a cool premise.
so what does my game have?

a streak system, you can only buy stuff in the streak from the stuff you earned in the streak
so there's no grinding and hoarding money until all the risk is ripped away.

you can only permanently unlock cars if you meet the specific car quotas. and exit the streak.

---

want a murci? well you first earn the money, get the murci in the streak, then complete the quota of said car to unlock it permanently.

you need 120k to earn the right to drive the murci, 20k to own it + exiting the streak.

---

also the maps are locked behind a skill wall. it depends how many bosses you've beaten.

zero boss and you have one map, but alot of it is locked down, not areas of the map but secondary and even third road networks, as to not overwhelm the player.

you beat enough bosses, you make more cars available to unlock and buy, you unlock parts of the map, until you unlock a second hardcore based map.

which all of it unlocked from the start, with the exception of one end game route. the deadcrush.
