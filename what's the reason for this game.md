what's the purpose of this game? why should people pick it over something else?

people chose games because it has a cool premise.

Hypermanic Hypermania is risk incarnate.

you're navigating a sugar coated hell.

it has a streak system, you can only buy stuff in the streak from the stuff you earned in the streak.

so there's no grinding and hoarding money until all the risk is ripped away.

you can only permanently unlock cars if you buy it. and exit the streak without losing.

---

want a murci? well you first earn the money, get the murci in the streak, then leave the streak before its too late.

you need 120k to earn the right to drive the murci, then you need to exit the streak.

---

you can lose the streaks immediately.

your car can get damaged in individual parts.

like engine damage, suspension damage, tire damage, body damage.

the damage can carry throughout the streak if not and if not dealt with will get worse and worse.

spike strips kill your tires, ramming fks up your suspensions and body.

water fks up your engine, and too much body damage and you lose alot of downforce.

the damage system is visually shown through baked in shape keys.

one for the front, the other for the back, one is for the left and right, and up.

the game doesn't have normal enemies, which drive the same cars that you can play.

well it least it doesn't start that way, in the first class you drive against normal enemies.

the further you go into the game the more modified and twisted the cars are.

and the more twisted cars the less it plays on the main rules set for the playable cars.
as in, they don't follow normal design conventions.

all the custom enemies will be saved in the car model folder under its own "enemies" folder.

you also need fuel to actually run the car. each car has its own fuel tank, which is gained through killing others.
