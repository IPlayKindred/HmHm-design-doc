I will work on this when I am done with the first game.

- a damage system that interprets all the collisions and moves the related vertices in each mesh in an export list.
- a project that focuses on the camera and how it moves. replicating actual cinematographic camera work.
- a vfx + sfx related project that tries to make the driving as dramatic as possible.
- a project that focuses on the AI and tries to make them as intelligent as possible.
	  meaning there are more reactions to more states and actions.
