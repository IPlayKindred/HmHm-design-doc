think of it that way.

you get in the car collisions to a var

you'll get all the meshs under the car body.

you go through every collision vert and calculate its normals to ever mesh vert.

so when the car crashes it just deforms said mesh.

but I'll use a vert shader

so it will be added to every single mesh using a script.

but honestly, this could a whole sperate project on its own, so make a "game" where its just a plane arena with half assed walls where you go break the car as much as possible.

SO DONT ADD THIS TO THE CURRENT GAME, ADD IT TO A SEQUEL.
