to make the map, use the [[map making plan]]

map:

- northwest nowhere:
	   ![[shutterstock_471847652.0.jpg]]
	- inspired by boston
	- the main roads are easy to drive on and copy the flow of most wanted 2012.
	- jumps from main roads lead to secondary roads.
	- secondary roads are the liminal space between main and 3rd roads.
	- 3rd roads can be as wild, open, tight as you want, go wild.
	- 3rd roads can be tracks, extremely intensive jumps. or rally roads disguised. 
	- all the roads can lead to each other except for the main road.

we have come full circle, I think I'll just copy the mw12 map. and I mean in copy, just take inspiration. and add my own style.

infact, take the layout and make it flow better.

please for the love of god make the map small, if its starting to get repetitive add more map later in updates.

now I gotta define what small is.
