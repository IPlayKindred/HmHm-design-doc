here's the thought process I have for working on the project
- articulate the process
	  so you don't forget it while executing the ideas or delving into details.
- challenge pre-established ideas or tropes.
	  if the idea has been done before, figure out how it works, and why it exists and try to challenge it, if a mechanic in the game doesn't challenge pre-existing ideas, there's no reason why someone would pick up my game over another that does that idea better.
	  
	tools and assets are an exception to this, but that doesn't mean you can't make them follow it if you see it fit.
- don't worry to much about the execution until you get to it.
- don't give away the solution before presenting the problem.
	  for example, don't show the item system until the player loses the first race.
	  don't show the streak system until the player loses the second race.
	  
	don't introduce the player how to refill the car without making the player run out of fuel first.
	
	don't explain how enemies behave directly, but instead slowly introduce behaviors for first encounters.
	
	don't show the damage system until the player actually damages the car.
	
	don't introduce the ers system without presenting the player with seemingly impossible jumps and stunts that they wouldn't be able to pull it off without said system.
	
	etc.
- don't explain anything through written text, use diegetic approaches instead.
- if there's a problem in the project, implement the fix to be as close to it as possible
- 1 problem, 1 fix, don't use 1 fix to fix multiple problems.
- do your due diligence
	  if something is hard to work on, close the project, remove all distractions, purposefully make yourself bored, until you come up with a solution, write it down, then execute it. 
- avoid big reveals, so you can course correct choices.
